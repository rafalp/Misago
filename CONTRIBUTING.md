Contributing
============

Thank you for taking an interest in contributing to Misago!

This document is a short guide for common contributions:


Translations
------------

Misago's translations are maintained on a separate service, [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/misago/). To contribute translations create an account there and request to join your language's translation team or request new language being added if a translation for it doesn't exist yet.

Pull requests with new translations on GitHub will be rejected.


Working on existing issue
-------------------------

Unless the issue is assigned to somebody, it's considered available for taking.

Please note that some of the issues may be very old and not up to date anymore. **Always ask** in the issue first before actually starting development.


Feature requests and improvement suggestions
--------------------------------------------

Unless the feature or improvement is 100% code-oriented and transparent to the end users, please first post a proposal for it on the [project's forums](https://misago-project.org/c/feedback/28/) for others to discuss and provide their feedback.

Please note that I am rejecting features that:

- I am unable to personally commit to maintain in the future.
- That are out of scope of the project.
- Are too tailored for a specific use case and won't be helpful to the vast majority of Misago users.

Even if I reject a feature, usually I am still be open to including new extension points in Misago to make such a feature possible through a plugin.


New pull requests
-----------------

Pull requests fixing bugs, spelling or updating dependencies are welcome.

New feature pull requests won't be merged if they were not preceded by a discussion on the [project's forums](https://misago-project.org/c/feedback/28/) and green lit by me (see the above section).

Pull requests not associated with any issue or forum discussion must contain an explanation of why the change is introduced in the first place. Misago is a large codebase, and I am not always able to discern the intended purpose of the change from the code alone.

Thank you!
