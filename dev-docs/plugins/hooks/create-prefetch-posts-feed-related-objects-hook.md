# `create_prefetch_posts_feed_related_objects_hook`

This hook wraps the standard function Misago uses to create a `PrefetchPostsFeedRelatedObjects` object, which is used to prefetch related objects for items displayed in a posts feed.

The object itself does not implement prefetch logic but instead maintains a list of prefetch operations to be executed in order to fetch the objects from the database.

Additional prefetch operations can be added using the `add`, `add_after` and `add_before` methods.


## Location

This hook can be imported from `misago.threads.hooks`:

```python
from misago.threads.hooks import create_prefetch_posts_feed_related_objects_hook
```


## Filter

```python
def custom_create_prefetch_posts_feed_related_objects_filter(
    action: CreatePrefetchPostsFeedRelatedObjectsHookAction,
    settings: DynamicSettings,
    permissions: UserPermissionsProxy,
    posts: Iterable[Post],
    *,
    categories: Iterable[Category] | None=None,
    threads: Iterable[Thread] | None=None,
    thread_updates: Iterable[ThreadUpdate] | None=None,
    attachments: Iterable[Attachment] | None=None,
    users: Iterable['User'] | None=None,
) -> 'PrefetchPostsFeedRelatedObjects':
    ...
```

A function implemented by a plugin that can be registered in this hook.


### Arguments

## Example

The code below implements a custom filter function that includes a new prefetch operation:

```python
from typing import Iterable

from misago.attachments.models import Attachment
from misago.categories.models import Category
from misago.conf.dynamicsettings import DynamicSettings
from misago.permissions.proxy import UserPermissionsProxy
from misago.plugins.hooks import FilterHook
from misago.threads.models import Post, Thread, ThreadUpdate
from misago.threads.prefetch import PrefetchPostsFeedRelatedObjects
from misago.users.models import User

from .plugin.models import PluginModel


def fetch_posts_plugin_data(
    data: dict,
    settings: DynamicSettings,
    permissions: UserPermissionsProxy,
):
    data["plugin_models"] = {}
    ids_to_fetch: set[int] = set()

    for post in data["posts"].values():
        ids_to_fetch.add(post.plugin_data["plugin_object_id"])

    if ids_to_fetch:
        queryset = PluginModel.objects.filter(id__in=ids_to_fetch)
        data["plugin_models"] = {u.id: u for u in queryset}


@create_prefetch_posts_feed_related_objects_hook.append_filter
def include_custom_filter(
    action: CreatePrefetchPostsFeedRelatedObjectsHookAction,
    settings: DynamicSettings,
    permissions: UserPermissionsProxy,
    posts: Iterable[Post],
    *,
    categories: Iterable[Category] | None = None,
    threads: Iterable[Thread] | None = None,
    thread_updates: Iterable[ThreadUpdate] | None = None,
    attachments: Iterable[Attachment] | None = None,
    users: Iterable["User"] | None = None,
) -> PrefetchPostsFeedRelatedObjects:
    prefetch = action(
        settings,
        permissions,
        posts,
        categories=categories,
        threads=threads,
        thread_updates=thread_updates,
        attachments=attachments,
        users=users,
    )

    prefetch.add_operation(fetch_posts_plugin_data)

    return prefetch
