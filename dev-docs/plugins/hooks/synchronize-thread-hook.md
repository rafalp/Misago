# `synchronize_thread_hook`

This hook allows plugins to replace or extend the logic used to synchronize threads.

Thread synchronization updates a threadâ€™s reply count, the IDs and timestamps of the first and last posts, the attributes of the first and last posters, and status flags such as has_unapproved_posts.

```python
from misago.threads.hooks import synchronize_thread_hook
```


## Filter

```python
def custom_synchronize_thread_filter(
    action: SynchronizeThreadHookAction,
    thread: Thread,
    data: dict,
    commit: bool=True,
    request: HttpRequest | None=None,
) -> None:
    ...
```

@synchronize_thread_hook.append_filter
def record_private_thread_owner_change_actor_ip(
    action,
    actor: User | str | None,
    thread: Thread,
    new_owner: User,
    request: HttpRequest | None = None,

    thread_update = action(actor, thread, new_owner, request)
