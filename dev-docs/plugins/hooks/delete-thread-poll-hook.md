## Example

This plugin automatically hides newly created thread update if deleted poll existed for less than 15 minutes.

```python
from django.http import HttpRequest
from django.utils import timezone
from misago.polls.hooks import delete_thread_poll_hook
from misago.polls.models import Poll
from misago.threads.models import Thread
from misago.threadupdates.hide import hide_thread_update
from misago.threadupdates.models import ThreadUpdate
from misago.users.models import User

@delete_thread_poll_hook.append_filter
def delete_plugin_relations(
    action,
    thread: Thread,
    poll: Poll,
    user: User,
    request: HttpRequest | None,
) -> ThreadUpdate:
    # Run standard deletion logic
    thread_update = action(thread, poll, user, request)

    poll_age = timezone.now() - poll.started_at
    if poll_age.total_seconds() < 900:
        hide_thread_update(thread_update, request)

    return thread_update
```
