# Plugin guide

Misago implements a plugin system that enables customization and extension of the core functionality of the software.

> **Plugins vs forking Misago**
>
> It may seem simpler (and faster) to fork and change Misago directly instead of using a plugins. While this is possible, the time required to later keep the fork in sync with new versions of Misago for every site update may quickly add up, resulting in a net loss of time.
>
> It is recommended to attempt achieving as much as possible through plugins. In situations where this is not feasible, consider [reaching out to the developers](https://misago-project.org/c/development/31/) before resorting to forking. Misago's current extension points list is not complete, and new ones may be added in future releases based on user feedback.


## Plugin installation

To install a plugin, place its directory in the standard `plugins` directory within your Misago setup.

Example plugin must be a directory containing a valid Python package with a `misago_plugin.py` file.

This graph shows the file structure of a minimal valid plugin:

```
- minimal-plugin
  - minimal_plugin
    - __init__.py
    - misago_plugin.py
```

Minimal plugin has:

- `minimal-plugin`: a directory that contains all the plugin's files.
- `minimal_plugin`: a Python package (and a Django application) that Misago will import.
- `__init__.py`: a file that makes `minimal_plugin` directory a Python package.
- `misago_plugin.py`: a file that makes `minimal_plugin` directory a Misago plugin.

The  `minimal-plugin` and `minimal_plugin` directories can contain additional files and directories. The `minimal-plugin` directory may include a `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` file to define the plugin's dependencies. It could also include a hidden `.git` directory if plugin was cloned from a Git repository.

Plugins following the above file structure are discovered and installed automatically at the Misago's Docker image build time.


## Writing custom plugin

- django applications mechanism
- plugin structure


## Plugin data

- explain what `plugin-data` model field is
- generated list plugin data models


## Hooks

Hooks are predefined locations in Misago's code where plugins can inject custom Python functions to execute as part of Misago's standard logic.
