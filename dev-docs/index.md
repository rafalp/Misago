# Misago Developer Reference

This directory contains reference documents for Misago developers.

> **Note:** This documentation is a temporary solution. In future I aim to generate Misago's dev documentation from it's codebase, and use Docusaurus to both version it and make it more attractive to browse.


## Notifications

Misago's notifications feature is implemented in the `misago.notifications` package.

- [Notifications reference](./notifications.md)


## Plugins

Misago implements a plugin system that extends [Django's existing application mechanism](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/applications/), allowing developers to customize and extend standard features.
