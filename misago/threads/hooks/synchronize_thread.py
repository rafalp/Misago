    This hook allows plugins to replace or extend the logic used to
    synchronize threads.

    Thread synchronization updates a threadâ€™s reply count, the IDs and timestamps
    of the first and last posts, the attributes of the first and last posters,
    and status flags such as has_unapproved_posts.
