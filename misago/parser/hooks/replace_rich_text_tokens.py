    This hook wraps the standard function that Misago uses to replace rich-text
    tokens in pre-rendered HTML or the next filter from another plugin.

    Tokens are pseudo-HTML elements like `<attachment="..">` that are replaced
    with real HTML markup instead.

    The code below implements a custom filter function that replaces default spoiler
    block summary with a custom message:

    ```python
