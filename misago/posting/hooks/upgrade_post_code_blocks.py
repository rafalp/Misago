    This hook wraps the standard Misago function used to upgrade a post's
    code blocks after it has been posted.

    The standard code highlighting feature runs in a Celery task because Pygments
    can get stuck in an infinite loop due to unknown bugs or malicious input.

    # Example

    The code below implements a custom filter function that highlights code using
    custom implementation:

    ```python
    from misago.posting.hooks import upgrade_post_code_blocks_hook
    from misago.threads.models import Post


    @upgrade_post_code_blocks_hook.append_filter
    def plugin_upgrade_post_code_blocks(action, post: Post):
        if post.metadata.get("highlight_code"):
            post.parsed = custom_highlight_code_util(post.parsed)
            post.metadata.pop("highlight_code")
            post.save(update_fields=["parsed", "metadata"])
