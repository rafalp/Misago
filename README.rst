Development
===========

Preferred way to run Misago development instances on your machine is with `Docker <https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download>`_, which makes it easy to spin up arbitrary number of instances running different code with separate databases and dependencies besides each other.

To start, clone the repository and run ``./dev init`` command in your terminal. This will build necessary docker containers, install python dependencies and initialize the database. After command does its magic, you will be able to start development server using the ``docker-compose up`` command.

After development server starts, visit the ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/`` in your browser to see your Misago installation.

Admin Control Panel is available under the ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/admincp/`` address. To log in to it use ``Admin`` username and ``password`` password.

The ``./dev`` utility implements other features besides the ``init``. Run it without any arguments to get the list of available actions.


Running Misago in development without `dev`
-------------------------------------------

You may skip `./dev init` and setup dev instance manually, running those commands:

1. `docker-compose build` - builds docker containers
2. `docker-compose run --rm misago python manage.py migrate` - runs migrations
3. `docker-compose run --rm misago python manage.py createsuperuser` - creates test user
4. `docker-compose up` - starts dev server


Frontend
--------

With exception of Admin Panel, Misago frontend relies heavily on React.js components backed by Django API. This application uses webpack for building.

Currently Misago defines following taks:

* **npm run build** does production build of Misago's assets, concating and minifying javascripts, css and images, as well as moving them to misago/static directory.
* **npm run start** does quick build for assets (concat assets into single files, compile less, deploy to misago/static but don't minify/optimize) as well as runs re-build when less/js changes.
* **npm run prettier** formats code with prettier.
* **npm run eslint** lints code with eslint.

To start work on custom frontend for Misago, fork and install it locally to have development forum setup. You can now develop custom theme by modifying assets in ``frontend`` directory, however special care should be taken when changing source javascripts.

Misago defines template that allows you to include custom html and js code before Misago's JavaScript app is ran, named **scripts.html**.
